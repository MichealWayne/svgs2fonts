# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on enhancing the tool capabilities of the svgs2fonts library and improving its overall performance. The goal is to expand the functionality available to users while optimizing the existing processes to handle larger workloads more efficiently and provide a better developer experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want enhanced tool capabilities so that I can perform more complex font generation tasks with additional customization options.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user specifies advanced font generation options THEN the system SHALL provide extended configuration parameters for font output formats
2. WHEN a user requests batch processing capabilities THEN the system SHALL support processing multiple SVG directories simultaneously
3. WHEN a user needs custom naming conventions THEN the system SHALL allow configurable file naming patterns and output structures
4. IF a user specifies template customization THEN the system SHALL generate HTML/CSS demos with user-defined templates
5. WHEN a user requires font subsetting THEN the system SHALL provide options to include only specified glyphs in the output font

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want improved performance so that I can process large sets of SVG files quickly and efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing large SVG collections (>100 files) THEN the system SHALL complete generation in under 50% of the current processing time
2. WHEN multiple font formats are requested THEN the system SHALL generate them in parallel rather than sequentially
3. WHEN SVG files are processed THEN the system SHALL implement caching mechanisms to avoid reprocessing unchanged files
4. IF memory usage exceeds reasonable limits THEN the system SHALL implement streaming processing for large datasets
5. WHEN errors occur during processing THEN the system SHALL continue processing remaining files and provide detailed error reporting

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want better monitoring and debugging capabilities so that I can understand and optimize my font generation workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN font generation is running THEN the system SHALL provide real-time progress indicators and processing statistics
2. WHEN verbose mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL output detailed logging information about each processing step
3. WHEN performance analysis is requested THEN the system SHALL provide timing breakdowns for different processing phases
4. IF processing fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with actionable troubleshooting guidance
5. WHEN generation completes THEN the system SHALL output summary statistics including file counts, sizes, and processing times

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want extended output format support so that I can generate fonts in additional formats required by my projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN modern font formats are requested THEN the system SHALL support WOFF2 optimization and variable font generation
2. WHEN legacy support is needed THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing font formats
3. WHEN web optimization is required THEN the system SHALL provide compressed output options with size optimization
4. IF custom font metrics are specified THEN the system SHALL allow adjustment of baseline, ascent, and descent values
5. WHEN icon fonts are generated THEN the system SHALL support Unicode Private Use Area assignments with collision detection
